# ASEAN COVID-19 Vaccination Analysis

## About the Project

This project aims to analyze COVID-19 vaccination data across 10 ASEAN countries over the period of 2021-2022. As a data analyst working with the World Health Organization (WHO), the goal is to assess the progress and distribution of vaccines within these nations, identify potential issues in vaccine distribution, and provide insights to improve vaccination strategies.

## Project Background

COVID-19 has had a profound impact globally, and vaccination efforts are critical in combating the pandemic. The WHO has tasked data analysts with monitoring and analyzing vaccination rates to ensure that the goal of vaccinating a significant portion of the population is met. This project uses the SMART framework to identify problems and evaluate vaccination progress in ASEAN countries.

## SMART Framework

- **Specific**: Analyze whether the average population in ASEAN countries has been vaccinated against COVID-19.
- **Measurable**: Ensure at least a 50% increase in the number of vaccinated individuals from the start of 2020.
- **Achievable**: By the end of 2022, aim for 90% of the population in ASEAN countries to be vaccinated.
- **Relevant**: The equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines is expected to reduce the death toll caused by the virus.
- **Time-bound**: The goal is set to be achieved within two years, from 2020 to 2022.

## About the Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle. It contains detailed information about COVID-19 vaccination progress, including types of vaccines used, daily vaccination rates, and overall vaccination rates across ASEAN countries.

### Dataset Reference:

- **COVID-19 World Vaccination Progress**: [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpreda/covid-world-vaccination-progress)

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Conclusion

The analysis reveals several key insights into the vaccination progress in ASEAN countries:

- **Vaccine Utilization**: The data provides insights into which vaccines are most widely distributed across ASEAN nations.
- **Country Performance**: Daily vaccination rates vary significantly across countries, with some achieving higher rates than others.
- **Vaccination Trends**: A consistent upward trend in vaccination rates was observed, with a notable increase over the studied period.
- **Vaccine-Related Patterns**: Associations between the type of vaccine used and the period of administration were explored.

## Model & Analysis

While this project is primarily focused on descriptive and exploratory analysis, the insights gained can be leveraged for predictive modeling and further analysis to optimize vaccination strategies.

## Recommendations

- **Targeted Vaccine Distribution**: Focus on improving vaccination rates in countries with lower daily vaccination rates.
- **Awareness Campaigns**: Enhance public awareness in countries with lower vaccination uptake.
- **Logistical Improvements**: Ensure the availability of popular vaccines in regions where they are most needed.

## Tableau Dashboard

The analysis and findings are also presented visually through a Tableau dashboard, which can be accessed at the following link:

## Future Work

- **Advanced Modeling**: Explore predictive modeling techniques to forecast future vaccination trends.
- **Regional Comparisons**: Expand the analysis to include comparisons with non-ASEAN countries.
- **Policy Recommendations**: Use the findings to recommend policy adjustments for better vaccination outcomes.
